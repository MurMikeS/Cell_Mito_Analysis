# Cell_Mito_Analysis

## Workflow
* Cell Mask and Mito Mask are generated by using convensional image processing methods. <br>
  (Thresholding -> morphological operation -> watershed segmentation)
* Identify the Mito regions belong to each single cell.
* Simple Mito Analysis and save the results. 

## Note
* This si a small application of cell image analysis
* Each staining sample image should be saved separately in its respective staining channel.
  * Channel 1 (saved as `file_name + '_c1_ORG'`) is used for cell segmentation,  and channel 3 (saved as `file_name + '_c3_ORG'`) is used for Mito segmentation.
  * If you have channel images with corresponding staining colors (e.g. DAPI is blue), please save them as `file_name + '_cX'`, where `X` represents the channel number. 
* Set the file path in the Main.py and then directly run it.Please review the parameter settings first.
* All the figure results will be saved in the Results Folder.
