# Cell_Mito_Analysis

## Workflow
* Nuclear Mask, Cell Mask and Mito Mask are generated by using convensional image processing methods. <br>
  (Thresholding -> morphological operation -> Mark-controlled watershed segmentation)
* Identify the Mito regions belong to each single cell.
* Simple Mito Analysis and save the results. 

## Note
* This si a small application of cell image analysis for Mito analysis
* Each staining sample image should be saved separately in its respective staining channel.
  * Channel 1 (saved as `file_name + '_c1_ORG'`) is used for cell segmentation.
  * Channel 3 (saved as `file_name + '_c3_ORG'`) is used for Mito segmentation.
  * Channel 4 (saved as `file_name + '_c4_ORG'`) is used for Nuclei segmentation.
  * If you have channel images with corresponding staining colors (e.g. DAPI is blue, or Neutrophil is magenta), please save them as `file_name + '_cX'`, where `X` represents the channel number.
* Set the file path in the Main.py and then directly run it.Please review the parameter settings first.
* All the figure results will be saved in the Results Folder.
* If the channel of nuclei doesn't exist, please tick the box of Advanced Watershed Segmentation (i.e. set the parameter `advanced_seg` as `True`)
